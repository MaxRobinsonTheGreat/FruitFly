# FruitFly
Welcome to FruitFly, a basic realtime multiplayer! 
This program was created by two amateurs to provide a basic set of code for a simple browser-based multiplayer game. 
Technically it is a game engine, but it is very imperfect. 
The code is currently quite voliatile, and is prone to change greatly in the future. 
For a more reliable javascript realtime multiplayer game engine, try [lance](http://lance.gg/).
